# Imitation Learning
This project aims to biuld a model for self driving cars based on immitation learning. A new set of data is collected from CARLA driving simulator. The neural network and procedure is based on a paper about conditional immitation learning by Codevilla et al. (2018).

# Files
general_functions: all various functions for reading files and visualization
image_augmentation: all functions for generating augmented images
